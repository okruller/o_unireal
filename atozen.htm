<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">A 
            legitimate question and one that would seem reasonable concerns the 
            very manner in which the new explanation of our reality offered herein 
            has been presented: what justifies foregoing its submission to a scientific 
            journal and the scrutiny of peer review? Although there are numerous 
            logistical justifications which are discussed further below, the fundamental 
            reason stems from the circumstance in which this understanding of 
            reality arose: (despite the scientific language and formalism of philosophy 
            in which it has been cast-) not through the 'scientific method' and 
            its caveat that objectivity in scientific methodology and its discourse 
            is unsustainable. </font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">A 
            well known if disturbing Quantum Mechanical effect that defies classical 
            science including Einstein's Relativity is the unexpected interdependence 
            between an event and its observer denying the possibility for complete 
            objectivity in scientific inquiry. Quantum Mechanics shows that the 
            most hallowed principle of classical science, the independence of 
            the observer from 'objective reality', is in principle disallowed 
            in the realm of quantum physics. The Copenhagen interpretation of 
            Quantum theory resolved the enigma by positing that while reality 
            is not objective but dependent on the observer, at least it is identical 
            for all observers.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">The 
            understanding of reality presented herein exposes a simple but 'fatal' 
            inconsistency in the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: 
            to an observer other observers are simply synonymous with other events. 
            Hence, its assertion that the reality of an event is at least identical 
            for all observers is incompatible with the validity of observer-event 
            interaction: all observers are mutually subjective thus the events 
            they witness are not necessarily identical. Accordingly, one cannot 
            escape the conclusion that reality is ultimately and inevitably subjective- 
            not just for all practical purposes of the human condition but in 
            principle. In other words Quantum Mechanics did not merely reach a 
            hidden and inaccessible aspect of reality but proves that it is the 
            scientific method itself that is the fundamental limit and reason 
            for science's inability to account for all of reality. For instance, 
            subjectivity introduces an uncontrollable element in any experiment 
            which modulates the outcome as self-fulfilling to each observer and 
            so limits the validity of an experiment and that of its repeatability. 
            Accordingly, while it may lead us to ever more complex descriptions 
            of reality, the scientific method itself cannot achieve the goal of 
            a complete account of reality. Hence, some advances in our understanding 
            of nature and of science itself can in principle only be achieved 
            by side-stepping its discipline until this barrier has been overcome, 
            in a sense analogous to the resolution to Zeno's paradox.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">The 
            circumstances in which the body of knowledge presented here unfolded, 
            precisely because the scientific method was suspended during a brief 
            lapse in observance of its regimen, is described at the end of the 
            'non-scientific introduction' (return 'back' for its link which conveys 
            the subject of this web site by examples that are expected to be more 
            accessible to those whose interest or background rather than scientific 
            tends toward its implication on human, societal or technological issues).</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Advances 
            that are not the result of the scientific method and in fact are proof 
            of its limitations, in principle and as substantiated by the method's 
            failing to produce these advances, should not be subjected to the 
            very process they found wanting. Moreover, these advances in understanding 
            include a consequence that the subjectivity mentioned above is carried 
            into the macroscopic world and thus, ironically, their submission 
            to a heretofore-unsuspected ambiguous process could have gratuitous 
            effects. The conventional course for submitting a scientific finding 
            thus becomes an unsuitable and unacceptable approach for the subject 
            conveyed by this web site. This rejection is meant not as a criticism 
            of the scientific method or scientists who abide by it but ensues 
            from recognition of its limitations- i.e. science and its methods 
            will be better for it- and acknowledges its entanglement with 'spooky' 
            quantum effects at a large scale of action. Hence, it was decided 
            instead that a web presentation would provide the best forum for dissemination 
            to a broad audience and forestall any consequences that were out of 
            context of the nature from which the advances had sprung. These concerns 
            were reinforced by recognition of possible institutional resistance 
            that would tend to protect an ostensibly successful framework for 
            scientific advancement, once its deficiency would come to light: in 
            spite of having had the world's finest intellects and extensive financial 
            resources at its disposal since the advent of modern science, (this 
            same deficiency conspired that) it had not delivered what had come 
            freely and without foreknowledge.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Other 
            logistical impediments provide further reasons for opting in favour 
            of a web presentation. Advances in science are typically in a specific 
            branch and area of investigation, which often elaborate on an aspect 
            of an existing theory or sometimes formulate a new theory. It would 
            not be realistic to expect that the subject of this web site, what 
            some have labeled the 'theory of everything', would follow such step 
            by step approach: its premise rules out its gradual discovery- like 
            a prime it has no factors, either it has or hasn't been found. Moreover, 
            the label 'theory' is not really fitting as this conjures up a hypothesis 
            supported by rationale but in need of a proof: analogous to a puzzle 
            piece that has a good fit yet also might be placed elsewhere- you 
            only know for sure whether it is actually correct when the puzzle 
            is complete. In contrast the 'theory of everything' is the completed 
            puzzle, you can see the whole picture and the placement of an individual 
            piece loses its significance to other issues: how best to admire the 
            puzzle's subject or whether it could have been cut into smaller or 
            larger pieces, possibly with different topologies.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Another 
            logistical problem concerns the treatment of in-and-oversights: a 
            typical paper might expose one such scientific finding. In contrast 
            this presentation uncovers and resolves not one but a significant 
            number of inconsistencies, lapses and contradictions in current understanding 
            and interpretation and does so in not one but in separate branches 
            of science: Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and Mathematics (again no 
            criticism intended, just another indication that the scientific method 
            precluded a more fortuitous development). Clearly independent papers 
            on each of these deficiencies would not just be cumbersome but separate 
            them from the singular source of their resolution and, hence, each 
            would fail to convey the overall expanded reality from which it had 
            sprung. Thus the challenge of reporting an integrated approach would 
            have resulted in such a voluminous submission that it would have exceeded 
            the typical limit on length imposed by major publications by more 
            than an order of magnitude, not to mention that their insistence on 
            strict adherence to a prescribed format leaves little room for the 
            more narrative style adopted herein. Neither could these publications 
            have accommodated its dynamics of (pop-up) comments, clarifications 
            with animated figures and philosophical rationalization that were 
            needed to promote clarity of a difficult subject. Indeed the volume 
            is more that of a book- and this would be the closer comparison with 
            this web site- which it was felt could be broadcast more equitably 
            (widely and inexpensively) and expediently on the web than through 
            more traditional publishing outlets.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Ultimately 
            our subject despite the form of its expression is not about physics 
            or mathematics but about our place in the structure of reality, not 
            its appearance but its innate language and the message this conveys 
            to us. Like linguists who are neither the custodian of language nor 
            make the rules of its grammar but with everyone else are its practitioners, 
            scientists merely infer and record the syntax of their subject. Wherefore 
            prior peer review has not been part of the process of preparing the 
            presentation at this web site- nature, the ultimate instructor has 
            no peers; we are all its perennial students.</font></p>
