<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

          <p><span lang=EN-US><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>An 
            Epilogue to a Prologue</b></font></span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">The 
            world we have known is the culmination of a long series of human developments 
            since a singular event marked the emergence of mankind: upon becoming 
            conscious of this world, man saw its reality divided into the (known) 
            present and a future unknown- its holistic experience fading away 
            as a hindsight into the just then acknowledged past.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">The 
            unknown comprises "the knowable"- from which in time we expect to 
            add to the "known"- and the "unknowable" (in the sense of inaccessible 
            to experimental uncovering and its reasoned verification). Resolution 
            of the "unknowable" either requires its refutation, i.e. validation 
            that our world is "knowable", or an unshakable faith in its ultimate 
            revelation. Either way we are drawn to fulfil the quest of life: that 
            we shall come to understand this world. For learning is the inescapable 
            result of being conscious and alive. And the lessons served there 
            will lift the veil from a part of the "unknown" considered "unknowable" 
            by some who, upon being confronted by the implications exposed herein, 
            would rather cry sacrilege than acknowledge the sanction of their 
            creed that truth shall prevail, as it surely will. For the familiar 
            world we take for granted will shortly end to be subsumed in the greater 
            reality of which you have just received a first glimpse.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Thus 
            we return to the singular role that is each of us students play: that 
            of the <a href="popups/popobs.htm" onClick="poptoc('popobs');" target="popup">observer</a>. 
            The topology of space-time revealed herein precludes that the observer 
            be no more than a Euclidean approximation. Since our body ostensibly 
            is Euclidean we must conclude that it is but our interface to the 
            Euclidean-like world we experience. This conclusion has profound consequences 
            that will need separate elaboration. However, let it suffice here 
            to summarize their essence: we observe and create our own approximation 
            of Euclidean reality from amongst that which is in space-time. The 
            fundamental principles why your reality should be so are tendered 
            in this discourse; the fact that it was written, i.e. that I was able 
            to perceive these principles, capture them in this text and that you 
            its observer can achieve a like understanding, substantiates that 
            we are not Euclidean; in a sense you have submitted to participate 
            in my macroscopic quantum trial. Our material body reinforces our 
            Euclidean world view until evidently it disintegrates- on the other 
            hand we the space-time observer simply are and thus are not subject 
            to the limitations of our carnal abode, in a true sense we <a href="subtexts/spinningcoin.htm">live 
            forever</a>. Hence, we cannot but observe- in a mundane context meaning 
            we cannot but learn and provide the ingredients of what others will 
            observe and learn.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">As 
            was hinted in the beginning of this discourse its appearance ultimately 
            will not just affect space-time physics and mathematics. In more ways 
            than those who coined the phrase may have anticipated, this is the 
            theory of everything. Its advent will have a profound, for some startling, 
            impact on our lives and on society- for a start this discourse has 
            primarily focussed on those fragments of our puzzle that are more 
            easily defined: the class and vector theories of mathematics, and 
            Relativity and quantum physics. The historical development of particularly 
            the latter theories is symptomatic of a common tendency to define 
            the aggregate human experience in general terms and use this as a 
            basis to explain individual behaviour and its conformance or lack 
            thereof to the norm. Not surprisingly this inverted approach leads 
            to arbitrary and inappropriate interfaces between a composite entity 
            and its constituent elements.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">This 
            discourse provides a philosophical 'ground zero' basis for the incongruity 
            between composite entities and their constituent units at any scale: 
            their respective contexts are axiomatically mutually discontinuous 
            (in the same sense that bricks do not define a house, which in turn 
            does not bestow specific meaning on the building materials). Consequently, 
            their <a href="subtexts/spinningcoin.htm">relationship</a> is not 
            hierarchical but one of parity, i.e. a compound entity is either defined 
            as a unit independent of any constituents or as a composite no larger 
            than the sum of the latter. Any attempt to subordinate individual 
            units to a composite will invoke a temporal factor that will ultimately 
            undo the latter (as a house without proper foundation will but stand 
            for a while before inevitably succumbing to stresses). We must understand 
            the indivisible at its most fundamental level and respect its inviolable 
            nature before we can address its aggregation and reconcile the latter 
            with the former. These same principles, when applied at the scale 
            of the individual, charge us with a personal duty not to limit others 
            from observing and exhort us that we cannot ever escape the consequences 
            of our action. Never mind the limited length and often twisted arm 
            of the law or the idea that some will evade punishment for their misdeeds 
            in death- there is no escape from teaching yourselves that lesson 
            which will erase your ignorance. Ultimately this life is not a contest 
            with others but a test of self: there is no other or collective institution 
            that can take responsibility for your actions. You have a right to 
            life and its rewards, everything else is privilege to bestow and receive. 
            You are free not to limit the liberty of others. Natural and unfettered 
            association is the only basis for optimizing economies of scale in 
            society: coercive participation, capricious divisions and barriers 
            contrived by your presumptious overlords, their compulsive and rapacious 
            demands are counterfeit and their perpetrators should desist at the 
            earliest. Tyrants and evildoers take notice: the nightmare which you 
            foist on your victims will provide the essence of an inescapable lesson 
            worse than your darkest fears in a world in which only the righteous 
            freed of ignorance will be fearless. Life also gave you a choice to 
            be just. Presently your latter days are over as those of the world 
            that we have known have passed: repent and better yourselves for you 
            have been served.</font></p>
