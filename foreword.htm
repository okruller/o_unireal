<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

        well-established and verified feature of Quantum Mechanics is the startling 
        but inevitable interaction between a quantum event and its observer. Some 
        aspects of the observer-event interaction exemplified by the indeterminate 
        condition of Schrödinger's cat (both dead and alive as long the observer 
        doesn't try to find out which) are fairly well known, and its more obscure 
        (and scientifically precise) ramifications have been thoroughly demonstrated 
        and discussed. Nonetheless, acknowledgement of one consequence of this 
        interdependence more profound than the quantum nature of matter itself 
        is usually evaded on the pretext that the questions it raises have been 
        put to rest by the formulation of the so-called Copenhagen interpretation 
        (of Quantum Mechanics, chiefly the uncertainty principle, wave-particle 
        duality and wavefunction collapse of quantum nature). The reason for sweeping 
        any doubts of its validity under the scientific carpet whenever a serious 
        discussion of this interdependence looms, stems from its denial of the 
        possibility for complete objectivity in scientific inquiry. If taken to 
        its logical conclusion observer-event interaction would not just undermine 
        the interpretation which rationalized it but affect the very basis of 
        scientific inquiry (alternative interpretations thus far have not adequately 
        addressed this issue either).</font></o:p></span></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000"><span lang=EN-US><o:p>Quantum 
        theory showed that the most hallowed principle of classical science, that 
        of the independence of the observer from 'objective reality' of which 
        Albert Einstein's Relativity was the ultimate culmination was in principle 
        disallowed in the realm of quanta. Physicists split into two camps with 
        on the one side the realists who maintained objectivity (at least on their 
        more familiar terrain of macroscopic scales) and argued that inner consistency 
        of Quantum Mechanics did not prove it to be complete- thus leaving room 
        for progress toward a resolution of the enigma of subjective interaction. 
        On the other side were the 'positivists' who (claiming that the cause 
        for the interdependence was inaccessible in principle) argued that while 
        objective reality is not independent of the observer it is at least identical 
        for all observers, thereby upholding another pillar of science: that of 
        the repeatability of experiments.</o:p></span></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000"><span lang=EN-US><o:p>The 
        real quandary and enigma of Quantum Mechanics is that the acceptance of 
        (subjective) observer-event interaction is incompatible with the assertion 
        that reality is the same for all observers: to an observer other observers 
        are simply synonymous with other events. Accordingly, we are forced to 
        conclude that ultimately reality is universally and thus inevitably subjective- 
        not just for all practical purposes of the human condition but in principle. 
        It may now be appreciated why scientists have affected its resolution, 
        Quantum Mechanics did not just prove that there exist aspects to reality 
        to which it has no access (contrary to some assertions it has not proven 
        that these are necessarily hidden from science) but that the scientific 
        method itself is fundamentally limited and ultimately is incapable of 
        accounting for all of reality (the method, not science is the limitation). 
        Subjectivity not only puts a limit on the validity of the repeatability 
        of experiments, but also introduces a certain self-fulfilling element 
        in any experiment. In other words while it may lead us to ever more complex 
        descriptions of reality, the scientific method itself cannot bring us 
        to the goal of achieving a complete account of reality and, hence, some 
        advances in our understanding of nature can only be achieved through a 
        process that (temporarily) suspends its discipline.</o:p></span></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000"><span lang=EN-US><o:p>This 
        outcome uncannily resembles that of Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorems 
        of mathematics, yet it is more profound since it pertains to all of science 
        and the way we perceive ourselves. A more direct parallel of this quandary 
        is with Zeno's paradox (in the paradox the protagonist ponders that at 
        the halfway point to its goal it will still only be progressing to the 
        halfway point of the then remaining distance etc. and so while ever getting 
        closer never will reach its goal). What resolves Zeno's paradox such that 
        it will let the protagonist go from A to Z, is to side-step its terms 
        of reference and proceed in discrete steps: A, B, C etc. What this means 
        for the goal of unifying science's two incompatible accounts of reality 
        is that the scientific method itself is the barrier through which we must 
        break. As Zeno's 'classical' approach needed replacement by a quantum 
        method, so the impasse left by the Copenhagen interpretation will require 
        an input external to what is accessible by the scientific method- a quantum 
        leap to the paradigm that bridges Quantum Mechanics to classical science.</o:p></span></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000"><span lang=EN-US><o:p>The 
        unification of the space-time geometry of Relativity and the quantum world 
        of Quantum Mechanics presented in this discourse did not arise as a consequence 
        of the new concepts that I have added to mathematics and physics. Rather 
        the fulfillment of this goal is the result of working with a complete 
        model from which prevailing misconceptions could be identified and deconstructed. 
        This approach made it possible to envision then rationalize which parts 
        if missing would result in the extant state of science- not unlike cutting 
        puzzle pieces from the picture on the box cover such that they match the 
        partially assembled fragments of the puzzle on the table.</o:p></span></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></font><span lang=EN-US><o:p></o:p></span></p>
