<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

          and Ramificaitons Of A Shift In Reality</b></font></span> 
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">The 
            presentation in this web site provides a shift in our perspective 
            on the nature of reality. Supported by animated illustrations it provides 
            the philosophical foundation for a new understanding of the reality 
            we experience and a scientific account in terms of mathematics and 
            physics. Its text exposes hidden and invalid assumptions in existing 
            theories clearing the way for a broader foundation on which to advance 
            physical science. As a result, familiar explanations of reality are 
            swept aside revealing a basis for resolving previously irreconcilable 
            conflicts and paradoxes not only in science but also in society and 
            our daily lives. The presentation introduces a purely geometric interpretation 
            of space and time. Its main text provides a scientific explanation 
            of this geometry's manifestation in our everyday reality as gravity 
            and electromagnetic radiation in both its wave and particulate form. 
            A non-scientific account may also be found at this web site. The discussion 
            that follows takes an informal look at the implications of this new 
            understanding on some of the more familiar assumptions and concepts 
            of science starting with an alternate 'no frills' deduction of the 
            conclusions in the main text.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Relativity 
            postulates that the velocity of light is invariant, i.e. it will be 
            the same in all inertial reference frames regardless of the latter's 
            differential speed. Light thus can be used as a gauge to measure both 
            space and time with the same scale. Accordingly, the distance travelled 
            by light divided by the number of ticks of the clock, its velocity, 
            will equal 'one'. Simply put <span
lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>space</span><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol;
mso-ascii-font-family:Arial;mso-hansi-font-family:Arial;letter-spacing:-.15pt;
mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:
symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>¸</span></span><span lang=EN-CA
style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>time=1</span>, although this relation is far from 
            a complete account, in essence it says that space=time. In other words, 
            space and time are alike, begging the question whether their dissimilarity 
            in our experience, rather than inherent is not a consequence of our 
            human vantage point that constrains our perception (the equality occurs 
            at the velocity of light, unfortunately riding along a light beam 
            is impossible in our human condition). The spatial dimension considered 
            by Relativity is always in the line-of-sight, the direction of the 
            light we see and, hence, of the space measured with our light gauge. 
            If we should turn at a right angle we will observe the same relation 
            between time and space in this new direction. Moreover, no matter 
            which way we turn time seems to be perpendicular to space, which has 
            led to the assumption that time has a singular omnipresent quality. 
            However, such a conclusion has a macroscopic bias: while a different 
            direction in space gives us different things to see, its essence like 
            time remains unchanged regardless of our orientation. Certainly we 
            do not conclude that two directions of space that are perpendicular 
            to the third and each other are therefore one and the same. In fact 
            there would be no contradiction if similarly to space, time would 
            have dimensionality (its resultant divergence in experience at a macroscopic 
            scale is discussed separately with respect to <a href="atozen.htm" target="ani">subjectivity</a> 
            in the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics). Moreover, 
            the dimensionality of time would be a more reasonable explanation 
            why we should encounter time's equality with space at the speed of 
            light. (Space and time in our terrestrial environment are usually 
            measured in meters or feet and seconds, these are converted by a constant 
            usually denoted by the letter 'c'- which since space=time, is dimensionless; 
            when using light as a gauge the constant as noted, equals unity). 
            </font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Electromagnetic 
            radiation (whose spectrum includes radio and microwaves, light, gamma 
            and x-rays) is constituted of two components that are at right angles 
            of each other and that propagate as transverse waves (sine-waves), 
            i.e. their magnitude at any phase is perpendicular to the direction 
            of propagation. However, as light from a point source demonstrates 
            the components are not spatial but arrive in the-line-of-sight, i.e. 
            perpendicular to the two dimensions of space that we can see directly 
            as opposed to the one in the-line-of-sight that we can only see indirectly 
            (the senses of a subjective observer do differentiate between the 
            space co-ordinates whose orientation Relativity presumes arbitrary 
            because it assumes the line-of-sight to posses an objective reality 
            independent of any particular observer). A sine-wave results from 
            the projection on a co-ordinate of a radial vector with a constant 
            rotational speed and translation of the co-ordinate at a constant 
            rate (moving it to successive parallel positions), hence, cannot be 
            considered fundamental. In fact if the two sine-waves projected by 
            the rotating vector on two orthogonal co-ordinates are recombined, 
            then the circle traced by the radial vector will be reconstructed. 
            It follows that the sinusoids and rate of rotation (indeed the progress 
            of time) derive from a more fundamental relationship.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Relativity 
            postulates that the velocity of light cannot be exceeded, meaning 
            any increase in a given direction in space cannot surpass the corresponding 
            advance of our clock. The reason for this limit derives from the geometrical 
            relationship between space and time, a hyperbolic tangent whose value 
            cannot exceed plus or minus unity (the main text at this web site 
            arrives at a similar conclusion regarding the limit on the velocity 
            of light from a different geometric perspective). Nevertheless, there 
            is a simple loophole to this restriction (i.e. one that does not contradict 
            Relativity) that becomes apparent if we acknowledge the dimensionality 
            of time and its equivalence to space at the speed of light: if indeed 
            they are equivalent then it should be expected that they can trade 
            places. However, keeping velocities at or below that of light in such 
            a transposed world means that in our reality the relationship between 
            space and time is as if superluminal (exceeding the speed of light), 
            except that we should not expect this condition to manifest itself 
            in any tangible way that the conventional laws of physics would regard 
            to be in violation of the principles of Relativity.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Perhaps 
            the most famous of all mathematical relations in physics, that is 
            even recognised by most who are not familiar with its principles, 
            is the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m) formulated by Albert 
            Einstein as a consequence of Relativity: <span lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>E=m</span>x<span lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>c<sup>2</sup></span> 
            (the actual equation also has a term for linear momentum of a particle 
            requiring that the equation be rendered as the 'square' of 'E'). Even 
            so, there is a fundamental problem with this equation: in its present 
            form it obscures a deeper meaning. We had previously noted that the 
            speed of light 'c' is no more than a conversion of space and time 
            increments to identical units of measurements. In other words the 
            square of this conversion factor (<span lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>c<sup>2</sup></span>) 
            in principle cannot convert a fundamental unit but must be understood 
            as the product of two such factors (<span lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>c</span>x<span lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>c</span>) 
            each separately related to two units of measurement which indeed may 
            be found in the equation when written in the form: <span lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>E</span><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:
Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:Arial;mso-hansi-font-family:Arial;letter-spacing:

lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>c=m</span>x<span
lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>c</span>. How does this recasting of 
            the equation explain why these same units (E and m) are nevertheless 
            apart by the factors (<span lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>c</span>x<span lang=EN-CA style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>c</span>)? 
            The new concept of geometry of space and time introduced in this web 
            site reveals other space-time domains on account of the dimensionality 
            of time. In these the velocity 'c' can be made up not just of 's' 
            and 't' but also other vectors, and includes relationships that are 
            inverted to account for the '1/c', which in a way can be interpreted 
            as a superluminal limit case: in other words E and m originate in 
            separate space-time domains. The presentation in our web site shows 
            that the elementary objects that comprise all matter are ultimately 
            not material but geometric in nature. Interestingly the apparent particulate 
            nature of elementary objects stems from their newly identified geometrical 
            property as the real manifestation from their 'superluminal side', 
            i.e. elementary particles are in effect 'mini' black holes. Of course 
            if you think about it this conclusion is all but common sense, after 
            all when you shine a light on any substance, some may be reflected 
            and the remainder is interpreted as being absorbed thereby increasing 
            the temperature- energy level- of the substance. The geometrical interpretation 
            would have some light get sufficiently close to the centres of the 
            substance's elementary constituents where it cannot escape the 'curved' 
            geometry of these 'mini' black holes.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">The 
            aggregation of elementary objects- the matter that constitutes our 
            bodies and the material world around us- conceals the behaviour of 
            its individual constituents. The following example illustrates how 
            elementary characteristics can differ from those of aggregate objects 
            seen at the scale of our normal surroundings in surprising ways. For 
            instance in every day life, when we hold a coin between our fingers 
            so that its denomination faces us and then rotate it about the vertical 
            axis say approximately 45º, we will notice a foreshortening in the 
            line-of-sight so that the horizontal length is now shorter (the coin 
            will appear oval). If we next turn our hand so that the vertical axis 
            becomes horizontal and rotate the coin again as much about the vertical 
            axis, the foreshortening that would shrink the horizontal length combines 
            with the earlier rotation and produces an effect as if we had rotated 
            the coin only once about an axis at a 45º angle to obtain an oval 
            coin whose major axis is at a 45º angle. In the space-time geometry 
            disclosed at this web site each of the directions of spatial rotation 
            has a corresponding temporal (time-like) counterpart (in one of the 
            three dimensions of time). Hence, for elementary objects these rotations 
            would not interact, so that the length in both horizontal and vertical 
            axes would decrease. In other words, if the coin could be an elementary 
            object, it would not turn into an oval but instead would become a 
            smaller coin. In effect its spatial extensions have turned into temporal 
            dimensions beyond the horizon of our perception. In the process non-spatial 
            physical phenomena are created that strain our comprehension such 
            as infinitesimals, microscopic and cosmological point objects. </font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">An 
            elementary particle exhibits rotations called spin that can only be 
            observed in an orientation which appears to depend solely on an arbitrary 
            measurement. This puzzling result has defied explanation by current 
            physics theories. The "standard model" of quantum theory allows that 
            point-like quanta such as electrons can exhibit "spin" and that photons 
            may have an orientation. However, if these are true vector properties, 
            the model's interpretation does not dwell on ramifications such as 
            that these are not recognised in infinitesimals by current vector 
            theory (direction of objects that have no spatial extension is presumed 
            to be a contradiction). The standard model of Quantum theory 'side-steps' 
            the potential enigma by adopting the position that the spin's internal 
            process cannot be interpreted as it is not experimentally accessible, 
            thus in principle can never be understood and, hence, only its external 
            effect is of consequence. The expansion of vector theory presented 
            in this web site permits that vectors that reduce to mere points may 
            still have an extension in an imaginary dimension, where for instance 
            they may contribute to geometric relations that are non-spatial and 
            exhibit rotation. Specifically, this geometry identifies a radial 
            vector that may rotate freely and is shown to comprise the component 
            vectors of electromagnetic radiation (whose frequency is known to 
            be proportional to energy- E), while the component vectors of another 
            radial vector are exhibited as gravity.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">As 
            a consequence of the understanding presented at this web site, hypotheses 
            such as the big bang, inflation of the physical universe and related 
            cosmological issues, the Quantum theory and its panoply of particles 
            are exposed as limit phenomena and artefacts of the way we observe 
            our macroscopic aggregate world. In a sense they are the creation 
            of the observer, that is us, as a consequence of macroscopic constraints- 
            measuring instruments made of aggregate matter (even when Quantum 
            devices are involved)- and unawareness of the dimensional nature of 
            time and associated vector spaces that had not been recognised as 
            constituents of space-time.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Much 
            of the above may sound far removed from every day life, yet our reinterpretation 
            of the reality of nature has a philosophical basis that challenges 
            current understanding of reality and will influence its experience. 
            As behoves a 'theory of everything' every aspect of society and our 
            existence will ultimately be affected. No doubt this new way of looking 
            at our world will spur technical developments that ultimately should 
            improve our wellbeing. However, its philosophical basis will also 
            affect existing aspects of our lives: many of the institutions and 
            boundaries that we had accepted as fixtures in human society will 
            be transformed or replaced to eliminate their coercive aspects, as 
            will the way we interact with others and the way we see ourselves. 
            A freer and more peaceful world should await us.</font></p>
