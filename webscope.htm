<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="This presentation confirms that the current understanding of space-time geometry is deficient and explains where and why. An integral account of the space-time continuum and its transformation to the quantum world is provided. In the course of its explanation the manner in which the fundamental forces of nature may be united is identified. Also shown is the origin of the breakup of the continuum into discrete quanta and of their interaction with the observer as cause for uncertainty in quantum trials. The unification of electromagnetism and gravity in a vector space that is fully consistent with the principles of Relativity will warrant the title of this presentation: Universal Reality.">

          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Early 
            in the twentieth century two successful theories were conceived that 
            to date have not been contradicted by the results of the numerous 
            experiments designed to confirm or disprove them. The first of these 
            was Albert Einstein's theory of Relativity that demonstrates, amongst 
            a number of physical phenomena, that space and time are not absolute 
            but depend on the (relative) speed between us, the observer, the instruments 
            that make space-time measurement for us and the event being observed. 
            The second theory, Quantum Mechanics, asserts that matter cannot be 
            divided into smaller and smaller portions but at a very small scale 
            reaches a particulate state (think of the shift that occurs when apportioning 
            rice, first a scoop from the cooker, then off your plate by the spoonful 
            until- here is the shift- only individual grains are left that no 
            spoon of any measure could divide). The theory was developed over 
            a period of many decades by a large number of prominent physicists 
            of whom Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger 
            are amongst those credited with its foundation. Quantum theory provides 
            very accurate predictions about physical effects at the microscopic 
            (spatial) scales of elementary particles called quanta. The arrival 
            of Quantum Mechanics also brought an apparent contradiction: the theory 
            of Relativity is not a Quantum theory since it permits its measures 
            to be infinitely divided, thus both theories appeared to be mutually 
            exclusive. </font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Relativity 
            actually comprises two theories: the "Special" and "General" theories 
            of Relativity. The latter is really a theory of the gravity (force) 
            field and its equivalence to accelerating a mass (think of how the 
            force of gravity initially seems to increase when we go up in an elevator 
            and then decrease as it comes to a halt at its next stop). The General 
            theory supplanted the first theory of gravity formulated by Isaac 
            Newton in the seventeenth century (with the hindsight of Relativity 
            a non-relativistic limit case). The Special theory is actually a general 
            theory of the geometry of space in which time is assigned a fourth 
            dimension in addition to the three of space. The theory describes 
            the relative character of what it calls 'space-time' that becomes 
            apparent at speeds approaching or equal to that of light with respect 
            to the observer. Now motion is not a force field and while light is 
            an electromagnetic force, Special Relativity is not a theory of light 
            either, but introduces an important and experimentally verified assertion 
            that the speed of light is constant no matter where we would measure 
            it (i.e. light is a physical phenomenon, its speed is another- albeit 
            related relation between space and time). The speed of light could 
            be measured in say a spacecraft that travels at a known fraction of 
            the speed of light. Let us suppose that a message is transmitted on 
            a laser light beam from its home planet to the spacecraft. According 
            to Relativity the crew would measure the same speed for the laser 
            light beam aboard the spacecraft as measured back on the home planet- 
            and not with the speed of the spacecraft subtracted on the outbound 
            of its mission or added when it is on its return trip. This result 
            forces us to accept that the velocity of light is the same everywhere, 
            i.e. it is invariant while time and space are not. </font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
            theory of electromagnetism is assumed to be compatible with the principles 
            of Relativity (whose central tenet after all is the constancy of the 
            speed of light), however, it was actually formulated by James Maxwell 
            in the nineteenth century, predating Relativity and thus is not considered 
            relativistic. Although Quantum Mechanics is not relativistic either, 
            further theoretical development has taken certain relativistic effects 
            on quantum objects into account. Quantum Mechanics deals with force 
            fields and phenomena of elementary particles at such a short range 
            that they are not apparent on human (macroscopic) scales. While gravity 
            and electromagnetism are experienced at a macroscopic scale, they 
            also have an observable effect on elementary particles. Scientists 
            have succeeded in unifying the two forces of the quantum world (the 
            so-called strong and weak forces) and have devised a theory which 
            connects these with the electromagnetic force (an electromagnetic 
            field can be observed in quantum packets called photons, its unification 
            implies that under certain conditions the three forces become identical). 
            However, Einstein's theory of gravity is geometric and not particulate 
            in nature, hence, so far all attempts to unify gravity with the other 
            three forces have failed (theories have been proposed in which gravity 
            waves also propagate in quantum packets, but none have been detected 
            to date).</font></p>

            'Unireal' web presentation introduces a new concept for space-time 
            and its geometry that expands Relativity and provides it with a broader 
            foundation (for the postulates of its theories). This expansion does 
            not so much show that Relativity is incomplete but that the conventional 
            understanding of it has been inadequate. Similarly, the conventional 
            interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is shown to be inconsistent. It 
            should almost be expected that two correct yet incompatible theories 
            should both be misunderstood: if comprehension of one would have been 
            complete it should have permitted identification of the deficiency 
            that rendered the other incompatible. This lack of understanding caused 
            a second way in which Relativity relates to our reality to be overlooked. 
            Although Relativity and the accuracy of its predictions on a macroscopic 
            scale was verified and confirmed on numerous occasions, neither yielded 
            any meaningful insight into the microscopic realm of elementary particles. 
            The presentation at this web site shows that the equations of Relativity 
            can be recast in a different form that is applicable to elementary 
            objects. The different way in which Relativity can be applied affects 
            our observation of reality by precipitating a discontinuity that accounts 
            for the dual nature of elementary particles: their wave and particulate 
            nature. Space and time are shown to have a truly geometric relationship 
            regardless of the scale at which these are observed. This geometry 
            explains the nature of time, electromagnetism and gravity, and provides 
            a basis for unifying the so-called four "fundamental forces" mentioned 
            above.</font></p>

          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Our 
            experience of space is that it has three dimensions, meaning any point 
            in space can be defined by the length (magnitude) of the projections 
            (called component vectors) of its location in space on typically three 
            orthogonal co-ordinates measured from the latter's cross-section (called 
            the origin). The line connecting the point to the origin is called 
            a radius or composite vector (of the component vectors). A vector 
            that lies on two intersecting surfaces is called a fundamental or 
            axial vector (about which the surfaces can rotate). Vectors have length 
            and direction like an arrow, the basic concept can be seen by holding 
            a long object, such as a ruler representing the composite vector at 
            some angle to a flat surface, the foreshortened shadow cast by the 
            ruler from overhead lighting will be like the component vector.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
            treatment of time in science is ambivalent: while quantum mechanics 
            will permit time to be positive or negative, Relativity assumes time 
            only to have magnitude (called scalar) as opposed to a vector which 
            has magnitude and direction. Yet in relativistic calculations time 
            always manifests itself as if a fourth dimension perpendicular to 
            the three dimensions of space, no matter the direction of the space 
            vector (the orientation of the space co-ordinates is arbitrary according 
            to Relativity). Hence, while not accorded direction in the sense of 
            having freedom of orientation, time is in effect acceded to be the 
            co-ordinate of this fourth dimension on which a time lapse lies in 
            essence like a component vector. Nonetheless, time in our macroscopic 
            world is assumed to go only forward, as it has never been observed 
            to intersect the past- the 'arrow of time' is considered unidirectional. 
            However, a component vector like our ruler above has a 'source'- it 
            is the projection of a composite vector on a co-ordinate, yet a time-like 
            composite had not been differentiated until this web site revealed 
            its existence. Instead Relativity assumes that the interaction between 
            time and space is a composite vector it calls 'interval' and overlooks 
            the inconsistency that it is formed between scalar time and a spatial 
            component vector.</font></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
            web site presents a philosophical basis for time to have three dimensions 
            just like space. This conclusion is reached by three separate approaches: 
            one by expanding a mathematical foundation known as class theory and 
            second by completing a branch of mathematics called vector theory, 
            and finally by clearing away anomalies in physics (in Quantum Mechanics 
            and Relativity) of which some have already been mentioned. Interestingly, 
            removal of the oversights, inconsistencies and false assumptions leads 
            to a geometrical relationship between space and time that explains 
            why the composite and component vectors that represent time should 
            all appear to be perpendicular to the three vectors of space. More 
            importantly it leads to the resolution of the incompatibility of Quantum 
            Mechanics and Relativity and so explains the three most enigmatic 
            phenomena of the reality we experience- time, matter and gravity.</font></p>
